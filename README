   http://linux.dell.com/libsmbios/main/index.html

Q: why do i have to run this script as root?

   AS LONG AS YOU RESPECT THE LICENCE ITSLEF

Q: can i reimplment the idea to make an application??
A: see next FAQs please.

Q: do you have any plans for the future of this script???
A: yes indeed. i'd like to make it a real application for KDE >=4 one day.

Q: why for KDE 4 only?
A: well i said KDE 4 because i use it. i'm thinking about Qt >=4 only really.
   so it will be portable across Linux, OS X and Windows.

Q: so... can i make the application??
A: indeed; i still can't code C++ and Qt so you are more than welcome.
   but if you do please let me know and we can use my repos.

Q: once the applications will exist and work, will this script be still available??
A: yes, i plan to make the application but the script will remain available for 
   people using CLI only distros and for those who don't want to install the application.

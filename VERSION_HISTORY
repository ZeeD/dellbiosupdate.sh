VERSION HISTORY:

0.1.3.1 Wed, Apr 01 2009:
	implemented new selection for var BIOS_VERSION_AVAILABLE with sed;
	removed html2text as dependency since new var doesn't need it 
	anymore; thanks ZeeD

0.1.3	Wed, Apr 01 2009:
	implemented "awk" and "sed" for a better selection for the vars:
	SYSTEM_ID BIOS_VERSION_BASE and COMPUTER; "cut" was fallacious;
	now it should get the correct values for all models;
	optimized "if which fi" ; thanks ZeeD

0.1.2.1 Mon, Mar 30 2009:
	using "awk" instead of "cut" to get the "Product Name:" 
	thanks to "lvillani" for feedback; Please test and let me know.

0.1.2   Sun, Mar 29 2009:
	use of "case/esac" in the select instead of too many if fi;

0.1.1   Sat, Mar 28 2009:

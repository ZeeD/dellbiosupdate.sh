   by your distro install tool and if some else package is needed. thanks.

A: yes, we plan to make the application but the script will remain available for 
   people using CLI only distros and for those who don't want to install the application.

A: nope. this script is for DELL only. you will be able to use "QtBiosUpdate" for that, one day.

Q: why do i have to run this script as root?

   AS LONG AS YOU RESPECT THE LICENCE ITSELF of course ;)

Q: can i reimplment the idea to make an application??
A: we are already going to do an application, at the moment it's just a concept and you can find it here:
   http://github.com/cga/qtbiosupdate/tree/master

Q: can i join "QtBiosUpdate" development??
A: there's no development at the moment, we're still planning.
   and since i can't code C++ and Qt yet and the dev has no time right now
   you are more than welcome to join even at this early stage.

Q: once the applications will exist and work, will this script be still available??
A: yes, i plan to make the application but the script will remain available for 
   people using CLI only distros and for those who don't want to install the application.

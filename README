FAQ:

Q: what does this script do?
A: this script updates the BIOS of any DELL PC, server, laptop, netbook. Interactively.

Q: does it actually work??
A: it works 100%, i use it regularly to update the BIOS of my own DELL XPS M1330.

Q: where did you get the process??
A: the script is based on the orginal DELL procedure howto:
   http://linux.dell.com/wiki/index.php/Tech/libsmbios_dellBiosUpdate

Q: which tools does it use?
A: It uses official DELL tools included in package "libsmbios" available for most distros.
   http://linux.dell.com/libsmbios/main/index.html

Q: why did you write this script??
A: basically i was tired of doing a repetitive task by hand.

Q: can i trust this script?
A: if you don't trust this script just see for yourself what the tools do:
   http://linux.dell.com/wiki/index.php/Tech/libsmbios_dellBiosUpdate
   http://linux.dell.com/libsmbios/main/index.html

Q: why do i have to run this script as root?
A: because updating the BIOS requires root privileges since libsmbios has to be run as root.
   NOTE: you'd run the process as root even following the DELL procedure by hand.

Q: can i use this script to check if new BIOS Versions are availble?
A: yes indeed, since version 0.1.1 ;)

Q: how do i do that??
A: just run the script and see if the selection has a new version, else quit.

Q: can i help somewhow??
A: yes indeed. help and ideas are welcome =)

Q: great!! can i contact you??
A: for any suggestions and contributions contact cga @ callea.gaetano.andrea@gmail.com

Q: can i reuse the script to make my own??
A: hey this is Free Software!! you can do whatever the licence i chose allows you to.
   AS LONG AS YOU RESPECT THE LICENCE ITSELF of course ;)

Q: can i reimplment the idea to make an application??
A: see next FAQs please.

Q: do you have any plans for the future of this script???
A: yes indeed. i'd like to make it a real application for KDE >=4 one day.

Q: why for KDE 4 only?
A: well i said KDE 4 because i use it. i'm thinking about Qt >=4 only really.
   so it will be portable across Linux, OS X and Windows.

Q: so... can i make the application??
A: i'm already planning the application with some KDE 4 developer. We plan of
   doing a proper one with Qt and usable for other vendors other than DELL too.
   to do this we are planning to make it modular since libsmbios works for any HDR BIOS. 
   the vendors might code something like dellBiosUpdate (DELL's tool) and we can add it
   in order to use it for any vendors' computer.

Q: great!! what will be the application called???
A: i'd like to name it "QtBiosUpdate".

Q: can i join "QtBiosUpdate" development??
A: there's no development at the moment, we're still planning.
   and since i can't code C++ and Qt yet and the dev has now time right now
   you are more than welcome to join even at this early stage.

Q: where will "QtBiosUpdate" hosted??
A: i'll create the git repo here once we have something to work on.
   
Q: once the applications will exist and work, will this script be still available??
A: yes, i plan to make the application but the script will remain available for 
   people using CLI only distros and for those who don't want to install the application.

	of the function :P)

0.1.3.1 Wed, Apr 01 2009:
	implemented new selection for var BIOS_VERSION_AVAILABLE with sed;
	removed html2text as dependency since new var doesn't need it 
	anymore; thanks ZeD

0.1.3	Wed, Apr 01 2009:
	implemented "awk" and "sed" for a better selection for the vars:

	use of "case/esac" in the select instead of too many if fi;
